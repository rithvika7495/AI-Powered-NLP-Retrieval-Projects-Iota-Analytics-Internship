# üß† Iota Analytics Internship Projects (Summer 2023)

This repository showcases the major projects completed during my internship at **Iota Analytics**, where I worked as a **AI/ML Intern** with a strong focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Generative AI**. The internship spanned from **November 2023 to January 2023**, and involved both research-driven and application-focused contributions to cutting-edge AI solutions.

## üß© Projects Overview

### üîê 1. PII Identifier with Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Developed a NER-based model to detect **personally identifiable information**.
- Tools: SpaCy, Presidio Analyzer, Regex, Flask.
- Implemented extraction for sensitive entities like:
  - Name, Gender, Email, Organization, Location, Date of Birth
  - Biometric ID, Financial Info, Criminal History, etc.
- Designed robust **error handling, deny lists**, and **Flask API** endpoints.

### üß™ 2. RAG-Based Generative AI System

- Built an **interactive question-answering** system using:
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - Llama Index (for vectorization)
- Enabled document upload + real-time querying with context-aware answers.
- Employed persistent vector indexing for scalable document-based search.
- Presented demo and received positive feedback from mentors.

### üéß 3. Audio & OCR Utilities for eDiscovery

- Converted speech to text using `speech_recognition` Python library.
- Applied **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** for extracting data from images.
- Wrote Python utilities to:
  - Auto-rotate and correct scanned documents
  - Generate multiple CSVs from Excel sheets based on parameters

## üíª Technologies Used

- Python (Flask, Pandas, NumPy)
- NLP: SpaCy, Presidio, Regex
- Generative AI: Hugging Face Transformers, Llama Index
- Deployment & Testing: Flask, Postman, Logging
- Auxiliary: `speech_recognition`, `python-docx`, OCR libraries

## üèÜ Key Achievements

- Built a complete **PII recognition engine** with customizable entity extraction.
- Designed and deployed a **UI with Flask** for NER-based document analysis.
- Delivered a functional **RAG-based system** for dynamic question answering.
- Received direct appreciation from supervisors for innovation and practical execution.
